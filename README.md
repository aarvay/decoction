# Decoction

Decoction is a static site generator written in Elixir. It is *currently
experimental*

## Readme Driven Development

### Introduction
I wanted to explore Elixir and the tools it come with. Writing a static site
generator seemed like an exciting way to to do that because:

 * Fundamentally, static site generators are about transformation of data, which
 is what functional programming encourages. Elixir would be a great fit for the
 job.
 * Elixir ships with tools like Mix, EEx, which could be used right off the
 shelf, for building, templating.
 * Also, why not Elixir(ify) everything? :smirk:
